# Data Structures Implementation

This repository contains basic implementations of fundamental data structures in computer science. The goal is to provide simple and generic implementations for educational purposes or as starting points for more complex projects. The included data structures are:

- HashMap
- Stack
- Queue
- PriorityQueue
- LinkedList

## HashMap

The HashMap implementation provides a key-value store with constant-time average complexity for insertion, deletion, and retrieval operations.

## Stack

The Stack implementation follows the Last In, First Out (LIFO) principle. It supports basic operations such as push, pop, and peek.

## Queue

The Queue implementation adheres to the First In, First Out (FIFO) principle. It supports basic operations like enqueue and dequeue.

## PriorityQueue

The PriorityQueue implementation maintains elements based on their associated priorities. Elements are dequeued in order of priority.

## LinkedList

The LinkedList implementation represents a linear data structure where elements are stored in nodes, and each node points to the next one in the sequence.

## Usage

Feel free to use these implementations as references or integrate them into your projects. Each data structure is implemented in a modular and reusable manner.
